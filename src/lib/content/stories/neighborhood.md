This article is still a work in progress

During my third semester myself and three others were tasked to create a website for neighborhood residents. The backend of the website had to be made with ASP.NET Core and SQL, the front-end with Bootstrap.

On the website, residents of a neighborhood can sign up and post issues or new ideas for their neighborhood. Other residents are able to respond to these posts and have a discussion to come to a consensus. The sign-up process included e-mail verification and physical address validation via a postal code lookup.
