title: 'Color Combinations'
description: 'An app to display all contrast-friendly color combinations of the given colors.'
summary: "During my time as a developer I've come across many interesting and nice looking colors. To keep track of these I keep them in a text file. I quickly realized however, that there wasn't an easy way to view the combinations of them. To solve this problem I created this application that displays all the contrast-friendly color combinations in a handy grid."
